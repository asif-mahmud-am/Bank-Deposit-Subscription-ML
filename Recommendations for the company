Recommendations based on the observation of the data:

1. More single people should be contacted as they have shown more interest in subscribing.

2. Cellular contacts should be made with customers. 

3. The people that should be contacted more are:
     Management, technicians, blue-collar job holders, admins and retired persons. 
   The people that should be contacted less are:
     Students, housemaids, unemployed's, entrepreneurs. 

4. Customers with yearly balance more than 5000 EUR should be of less priority as 88% of them did
not subscribe. Rather, customers who have balance less than 5000, should be contacted.

5. No need to make more than 4 phone calls. It seems 90% subscription was gotten when done 4 phone
calls. 

All of these points are also added in the notebook after doing the EDA. 

6. Also they can use the machine learning model's prediction to checkout if there is a possibility
that the customer can subscribe. It's not fully reliable, but it helps!
